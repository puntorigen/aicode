Project Path: {{ absolute_code_path }}

# Act as an expert software engineer and writer of documents and tutorials, you have a professional and friendly style. 
We need to create a friendly tutorial about the project in the given source tree in {{ language }}.

Source Tree:
```
{{ source_tree }}
```

# Analyze the following files contents and dependencies to understand what the folder is about and create an engaging tutorial that is easy to understand and follow:

{{#each files}}
{{#if code}}
`{{path}}`:

{{{code}}}

{{/if}}
{{/each}}

The tutorial should first describe what the tutorial is about, layout the steps we're going to implement and then follow them one at a time, showing all code snippets needed and then the final solution and deployment and bundling steps.
Feel free to infer reasonable details if needed, but try to stick to what can be determined from the codebase itself always avoiding replying there's something missing.

{{#if language}}
# Always answer in {{ language }}.
{{/if}}

```json:schema
{
    "tutorial": "tutorial content in markdown syntax"
}
```

```js
// nodejs code to run after getting results (runs within an isolated async function block)
// context vars: schema (results), absolute_code_path, files, source_tree, etc (all the template vars)
// save 'readme' schema.tutorial contents to disk (abs)
await writeFile(`${absolute_code_path}/TUTORIAL-${language}.md`, schema.tutorial + '\n\n### Generated by aicode');
log(`TUTORIAL-${language}.md saved!`);
// if you return an object here, it will be available for the next code block
```

```bash
# commands to run after the previous nodejs code block
```
