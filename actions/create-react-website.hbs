# if OS is different than MacOS we could ask the LLM for translating them to another OS later before execution
# any bash here executes with the env CI=true so it won't prompt the user for anything
# you may use context vars as {context.x} to replace with the variable value 
# e.g. {context.input} will be replaced with the user input
