# AI Code

AI Code is a command-line tool that provides automated support for code development. This tool can generate code snippets, project structures, and perform specific actions based on user input commands. Plugins can also be used to extend the functionality.

## Features

- **Code Generation**: AI Code can generate code snippets in multiple languages based on user input.

- **Project Structure Generation**: It can generate smart project structures for different types of applications.

- **Code Execution**: AI Code can execute custom actions defined by the user based on input commands. Plugins can be used to execute almost any type of action.

- **Context Awareness**: It can understand the context of a project and provide appropriate support.

## Usage examples

The following are some examples of how to use AI Code:

- To generate a README file for a project folder:
  ```bash
  aicode "document this project"
  ```

- To generate a README file for a project folder in Japanese:
  ```bash
  aicode "document this project in Japanese"
  ```

- To ask a question about a project folder:
  ```bash
  aicode "how many lines of code does this project have?"
  ```

- To ask anything about a project folder:
  ```bash
  aicode "what's the purpose of the codeBlocks.js file?"
  ```

- Try with other queries or create your own actions!
