# AI Code â€” Project Walkthrough Tutorial

The AI Code project is a command-line application developed by Pablo Schaffner, designed to automate support for code development. This tutorial will guide you through its main files, framework, and how to use it effectively.

## Getting Started

**Installation**

AI Code can be installed into your project using npm with the command `npm install aicode`. The following dependencies would be installed with it as defined in `package.json`:

- `@concepto/console`: for console formatting
- `code-blocks`: for retrieval and execution of code snippets
- `code2prompt`: for creating interaction prompts within the application
- and various other dependencies for languages, debugging, and rendering.

To ensure the package is installed correctly, check the 'main' key in package.json is set to 'index.js'. That is the main entry point of our application.

## How to Use AI Code

In `example_usage.md`, several standard commands you can run with AI Code are detailed. These commands can be used to generate project documentation, ask questions about a codebase, and more specifically to a file, etc. The AI Code utility uses a simple syntax that consists of the name 'aicode' followed by your command in quotes. For example, you can generate a README file for your project with `aicode 'document this project'`.

## Under the Hood

Let's breakdown the main script in `index.js`.

This scripts begins by importing necessary modules and executing configuration setup for the command-line interface (CLI). It relies heavily on `yargs` to parse and interpret the user-supplied commands. After initializing some variables, the script executes a sequence of actions: determining the user's operating system, deciding whether the user command is a question or action, running the best-fit template action for user input, and processing the input.

The `actions` directory contains markdown files, each representing possible AI Code commands. A couple of them (`write-tutorial.md`, `write-readme.md`) are executed when user input matches a command to generate a README or tutorial.

In `helpers/codeBlocks.js`, some helper methods for executing actions and providing context for them are defined.

## Creating Your Actions

In the `actions` directory, you can create your own user commands. Each file represents an action and inside, it contains sets of instructions for AI Code to follow.

## Summary

With AI Code, you can make coding and documentation easier and more interactive. You can create custom command-line interfaces (CLIs), automate documentation, and with the help of powerful AI algorithms, even make your coding assistant smarter by teaching it new commands.
